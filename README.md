**About the dataset:**
In this dataset, customer information is provided about the customer's state, call durations, etc. alongwith whether the customers leave the subscription (i.e., churn) or not. Thus, the customers are divided into two classes.


**Problem Statement:**

**Business Problem Overview:**
Predicting customer churn is crucial for every business since it identifies customers who are likely to discontinue utilising their services. Customers in the telecom sector have access to a variety of service providers and can actively switch from one operator to another. The telecoms business has an average annual churn rate of 15 to 25 percent in this fiercely competitive market. Customer retention has now surpassed customer acquisition in importance due to the fact that it is 5â€“10 times more expensive to gain new customers than to keep existing ones.
Retaining highly profitable consumers is the top business objective for many established operators. Telecom businesses must identify the consumers who are most likely to leave in order to reduce customer turnover. In this project, you will examine customer-level information from a top telecom company and do an exploratory data analysis to pinpoint the key causes of customer churn.


**Business Objectives:**

1.) To analyze the dataset for finding reasons of why customers churn the subscription.
2.) To find methods or recommendations to avoid the problem of customer churn.

**Conclusions:**
After thorough analysis of the dataset, the recommendations for avoiding customer churn are as follows: 1.) The international charge per minute is quite high and this might be the reason for customer churn. The pricing policy should be re-analyzed and changed.
2.) In certain area codes and states, customer churn is more. In such areas, network quality should be assessed. In case of poor network infrastructure, it should be replaced and the network should be upgraded according to newer wireless communication technologies.
3.) Customers with high day minutes and evening minutes tend to churn at a higher rate than do the other customers. For this, a market survey should be done. If customers are finding better network quality and lesser charges from some other company's subscriptions, suitable action should be taken to correct our company's policies.
4.) Training of customer service cebter profesionals should be done.
5.) Customer issues should be resolved timely to avoid churn.
6.) Ask for customer feedback regularly.
